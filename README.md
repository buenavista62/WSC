# WSC
Writing Smart Contracts course from USI

This project was part of the final assignment for completing the winter course taken place in the spring semester 2022. The provider of the course is the [USI](https://www.usi.ch/it/education/lifelong-learning/summer-winter-school/wsc).

## What is the goal of this project?

Write a Smart Contract that everyone who has less than 100 ALGOs in his/her account receives 100 ALGOs for free.

**Extensions**
1. Subtract the current holding from the free transfer, so that someone who hold 20 ALGOs would only get 80 ALGOs for free.
2. Only eligible citizens, who own the *Social Coin*, can receive the transfer.

The goal of the project is to deploy both a smart signature and a smart contract on the Algorand blockchain. The smart signature serves as an ASA (Social Coin) dispenser, whereas the smart contract pays out Algo for eligible users.

**Do not use this code on the mainnet. This code is not audited**
